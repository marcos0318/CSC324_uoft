# CSC324_uoft
The assignments from CSC324 program language. Mainly focus on functional programming

* A1.1 Implement ‘eva’, an algebraic interpreter for an augmented Lambda Calculus.
* A1.2 Implement ‘Eva’, a memory model based interpreter for an augmented Lambda Calculus.
* A2 Implement the functional API for computation that propagates false as failure, and use that to implement the associated Do notation. 
* A3 Type Checker with some Inference

The assignments are really hard to think and reason about. Still need to have more commemts to make the code easier to understand.
